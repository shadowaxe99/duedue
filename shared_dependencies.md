Shared Dependencies:

1. "contract_dates": This variable will likely be shared across multiple files as it is the core data that the application is working with. It will be used in date_extraction.py, filtering_sorting.py, notifications.py, data_analytics.py, and possibly others.

2. "supported_formats": This variable will be used in file_support.py to define the file formats that the application can work with, and it may also be used in main.py and user_interface.py to inform the user of the supported formats.

3. "user_config": This variable will be used to store user configuration settings. It will be used in user_interface.py for setting and changing configurations, and in other files for applying these configurations.

4. "cloud_services": This variable will be used in cloud_integration.py to define the cloud storage services that the application can integrate with, and it may also be used in main.py and user_interface.py to inform the user of the supported services.

5. "platforms": This variable will be used in platform_support.py to define the platforms that the application can run on, and it may also be used in main.py and user_interface.py to inform the user of the supported platforms.

6. "authentication_status": This variable will be used in authentication.py to track the user's authentication status, and it may also be used in other files to determine what actions the user is allowed to perform.

7. "extract_dates": This function will be defined in date_extraction.py and used in main.py to extract contract dates from files.

8. "filter_sort": This function will be defined in filtering_sorting.py and used in main.py to filter and sort contract dates.

9. "send_notification": This function will be defined in notifications.py and used in main.py to send notifications about approaching contract dates.

10. "sync_to_cloud": This function will be defined in cloud_integration.py and used in main.py to synchronize data with cloud storage services.

11. "generate_report": This function will be defined in data_analytics.py and used in main.py to generate reports.

12. "authenticate_user": This function will be defined in authentication.py and used in main.py to authenticate the user.

13. "check_platform": This function will be defined in platform_support.py and used in main.py to check the platform the application is running on.
